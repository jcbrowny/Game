# Rock Paper Scissors (with Hard and Extreme modes)
This is a game of the kids claccis Rock Paper Scissors, with some added extra hand signs for those that wanted a bigger choice pool.

### Tools
The languages used to make this where:

- #### HTML used to provide the basic layout of the page such as the buttons and images.
- #### CSS used to style the page and added colour.
- #### JS used to add interactivity to the html allowing it to become a game.
- #### JQUERY used in tandem with javascript to help simplify the code
- #### BOOTSTRAP used to make the implimentation of certain code easier


### How to play

- The game is just like the physical version, choose your hand sign and see if you win, if you do then the socre board will   give you a point, if you lose then the computer will gain a point. The game has no limit on the score you can reach.
- If you find that you what a bit more of a challenge then you can choose a higher difficulty that will increase the size of the hand sign pool.

### Development Process
- I started by first making three buttons and a score board and then add code to them so that the buttons would print out hand signs and the score board would keep track of which signs were printed
- After doing this I add win/lose/draw to be printed out in text below the scoreboard to make it easier for the user to keep track of which hand signs had been used
- I then went onto add basic style to the page to make it more presentable.
- Once the basic three hand sign game was done i wnet onto makeing the hard and Extreme versions of the game.
- I decide to add diagrams to the Hard and Extreme modes of the game so that the user can see what hand signs are available for them to choose.

### Issues
- I tried my hand at adding sound to the game, unfortunatly due to chrome making so that sound won't play on the loading of a webpage it made it harder than it needed to be, in the end I add a sound effects button that the user can click at anytime if they so wish.

### Future Develoment
- I would like to reduce the size of my code at some point, when i revisit this project, this can mainly be done by implimenting and array for the hand signs
